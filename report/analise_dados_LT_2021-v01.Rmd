# Abbreviations

- PJI:
- SD: standard deviation
- SIRS: systemic inflammatory response
- TJA:

# Introduction

## Objectives

Perform a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis on the deaths caused by PJI after a TJA surgical procedure.
Additionally, explore possible risk factor for PJI mortality in bi-variate analyses.

## Data reception and cleaning

**Analytical data-set**

1. id
1. age; continuous
1. sex; binary
1. sirs; binary
1. joint; binary
1. surgery success; binary
1. surgery type; categorical
1. multi-germ infection; binary
1. complication; binary
1. time (date PJI diagnosis -- date last follow up)
1. event (death due to PJI)
1. death (all causes)

Obs: Complication Type was considered for analysis, but could not be safely converted to a categorical variable.
It was dropped.

# Methods

```{r analysis, include=FALSE}
source("scripts/results.R", encoding = 'UTF-8')
```

## Outcome and covariates

### Event and time definition

- event: death due to PJI
  - deaths due to other causes were censored
- time: between PJI diagnosis and event

The event of interest for this analysis is death caused by the PJI.
For the main analysis patients that died from other causes were censored.
The time to event was defined as the number of years between the diagnosis of PJI and the last follow up noted.

There were multiple outcomes to consider regarding the mortality in PJI patients.
These causes were categorized as being caused by PJI (event of interest), other causes of death and survival (censored).
This multi-state outcome was used to assess the competing risks of death under the PJI risk.
The follow up time of all participants was considered in the person-year at risk.

### Covariates

- sex; binary
- sirs; binary
- joint; binary
- surgery success; binary
- surgery type; categorical
- multi-germ infection; binary
- complication; binary

## Statistical analyses

- descriptive analysis of study population
- Kaplan-Meier estimates for 2-year survival
- bi-variate analyses of covariates with log-rank test
- significance alpha = 0.05

Demographic characteristics were described with mean (SD) or proportions, where appropriate.
Kaplan-Meier curves were computed for the at-risk study population for the event of interest.
For all covariates considered the 2-year survival rates were computed for the event of interest.
The all-cause mortality was assessed using the competing risks overall figure.
Bi-variate analyses were performed using the log-rank test for all covariates considered.
All statistical analyses considered the significance level of 5%.

### Statistical packages

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version `r getRversion()`.
Packages used for survival analyses were `survival` version `r packageVersion("survival")` and `survminer` version `r packageVersion("survminer")`.

# Results

## Study population and follow up

- n = 54, 239 person-years
- sex: males: 21 (39%), females: 33 (61%)
- age: min = 32, max = 88
  - mean 64.3 years (SD 11.6)
- follow up time: min = 4 days, max = 16.35 years

## Mortality

- mortality: 5 PJI + 5 Other
- no median time for deaths
  - deaths times: PJI 4 days -- 2.13 years
  - Other 2.37 years -- 13.17 years
